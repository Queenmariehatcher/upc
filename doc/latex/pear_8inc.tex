\subsection{Detailed Description}
Makes PEAR work with extentions installed in the home directory. 

Most shared hosts do not allow user installation of system-wide PEAR extentions, so this file allows it to work with extentions installed in the user's home directory. To make this work, you need to set the HOME\_\-PEAR\_\-DIR constant to the path where your PEAR extentions are installed. See that documentation for more info.
